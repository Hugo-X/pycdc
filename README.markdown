# Decompyle++ 
***A Python Byte-code Disassembler/Decompiler***

Decompyle++ aims to translate compiled Python byte-code back into valid
and human-readable Python source code. While other projects have achieved
this with varied success, Decompyle++ is unique in that it seeks to
support byte-code from any version of Python.

Decompyle++ includes both a byte-code disassembler (pycdas) and a 
decompiler (pycdc).

As the name implies, Decompyle++ is written in C++.

## Usage

**To compile Decompyle++**

Linux:  
  Just run `make`.
  
Windows:
  1. `python bytes/comp_map.py` to generate python_xx.cpp files
  2. open `pycdc.sln` with Visual Studio (2008 or later) and build

**To run pycdas**, the PYC Disassembler:
`./bin/pycdas [PATH TO PYC FILE]`
The byte-code disassembly is printed to stdout.

**To run pycdc**, the PYC Decompiler: 
`./bin/pycdc [PATH TO PYC FILE]`
The decompiled Python source is printed to stdout.
Any errors are printed to stderr.
